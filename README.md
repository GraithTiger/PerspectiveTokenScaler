# Perspective Token Scaler

This module allows you to shrink tokens depending on how close it is to a vanishing point, allowing you to create a "2.5
D" effect.

## How to use

1. Create two drawings on your scene and set the text to:
    1. "scaler_start" for the point after which the scaling should begin and
    2. "scaler_limit" for the point that should represent the vanishing point
2. Start moving the token, and you will see it does its work
